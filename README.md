# EMI Calculator in Python

## Description
This program calculates the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) for a loan based on the principal loan amount, annual interest rate, and loan duration. EMI is the fixed monthly payment a borrower needs to make to repay the loan within a specified time frame.

## Features
- **Flexible Calculation**: Takes principal, interest rate, and duration as inputs to calculate EMI.
- **Precision**: Calculates EMI values accurately to two decimal places.
- **User-Friendly**: Console-based interaction with clear input prompts and formatted output.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with simple financial terms like principal, interest rate, and loan duration.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Using the Program

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed by running `python --version`.
3. Run the script using a command like: `python emi_calculator.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter:
   - **Principal Amount** (e.g., `500000` for a loan of $500,000).
   - **Annual Interest Rate** (e.g., `7.5` for 7.5%).
   - **Loan Duration** in years (e.g., `20` for a 20-year term).
5. The program will output the EMI value based on the inputs.

### Example Usage

```plaintext
Enter the loan principal amount: 500000
Enter the annual interest rate (e.g. 7.5 for 7.5%): 7.5
Enter the loan duration in years: 20
The EMI for a loan of 500,000.00 at 7.5% interest over 20 years is 4,031.87
```

## Sample Input and Output

### Example 1
**Input:**
- Principal: 100000
- Annual Interest Rate: 10.5
- Duration: 10 years

**Output:**
```plaintext
The EMI for a loan of 100,000.00 at 10.5% interest over 10 years is 1,351.97
```

### Example 2
**Input:**
- Principal: 750000
- Annual Interest Rate: 8.5
- Duration: 15 years

**Output:**
```plaintext
The EMI for a loan of 750,000.00 at 8.5% interest over 15 years is 7,398.95
```

### Explanation
The program converts the annual interest rate to a monthly rate, then applies the formula to compute the EMI, rounding the result to two decimal places for precision.
